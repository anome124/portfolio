                Following latest sneaker and clothing releases together with latest trends in the fashion world has always been part of my daily routine.<br> 
                 <br>However, I never had the time, motivation and relevant knowledge to start my own brand professionally, even though I have the vision, 
                 talent and passion for it. Not until the summer of 2019.
                 After spending a month in London with my best friend, who had recently graduated master’s in music production and marketing. 
                 While being in London , we visited various art exhibitions and social events which was the turning point for starting the concept of our fashion brand. 
                 After several days of discussions, inspiration and creating business plan, we were finally ready with the concept of TЯ Х МR.<br>

                A few words about the idea of the upcoming merchandise collection. 
                The new collection will consist of whole clothing line, including t-shits, bottoms, caps, fanny packs, socks and hoodies.<br>
                We were signed in a trade and press agency and that's when it all got serious.<br>
                In July 2017 after a long reflection I finally decided to leave.<br>
                The graphics for this collection will consist of details from fine artworks 
                of famous painters such as Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Michelangelo and others. 
                Implementation of trash and graffiti typography on the graphics will complete 
                the unique style of the collection and deliver high quality premium clothing line, 
                that focuses on young people, interested in street wear.

              <p class=" fw-1 justify">Heading back to my previous study, completed a mutual project 
                with the tourism board of Porto, Portugal. Our project team was sent on a field trip 
                to Portugal, where we conducted a two-week research, focused on the main highlights 
                and tourism development of Porto.<br> After completely developing a marketing-plan report 
                for the tourism board, we were requested to create a travel magazine, representing the main highlights, 
                events and interesting facts of the city. The magazine was later officially published and used as a marketing 
                campaign from the board. I took the initiative to put together the whole information and photo-material we 
                collected during our trip in a magazine, created from scratch on Adobe InDesign.<br>
                To be honest, this was my first time using this platform, which was a challenge at first. 
                However, it turned out to be a very interesting process that gave me the opportunity to learn new skills 
                and gain precious and useful knowledge about Adobe Creative Cloud.<br>The project was a success and the Magazine 
                was later used as an example for similar future projects in the university.

                <p class=" fw-1 justify m-b2">My latest project was during the second period of my current studies. 
                  Working together with Richie Elia was a great experience that thought me a lot on how to work in a team 
                  and how to manage my time efficiently.<br> 
                   <br>The project consisted of several main parts. Firstly, we were asked to conduct a user research and 
                   create a user-portrait that would help us later in the design phase. The main idea of this project was 
                   to create a meaningful digital gift-giving experience to our user and at the same time to develop a card 
                   personalisation tool for our commissioning client – Hallmark.<br>

                  My responsibility for the design part of this project was to come up with engaging and meaningful 
                  gift-giving experience. I had to develop a concept that was later implemented into digital prototype 
                  and final product concept.<br>
                  <br>This project was a great opportunity for me to develop further my research skills, learn to use 
                  platforms such as Adobe XD and strenghten my skills with usin the Microsoft PowerPoint and overall 
                  become more competent in the field of UX design and Prototyping.
